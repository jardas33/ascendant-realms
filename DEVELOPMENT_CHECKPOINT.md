# Development Checkpoint

Updated: 2026-05-04 19:55 -04:00

## Checkpoint Scope

This checkpoint records the verified Chapter 2 Cinderfen route reward audit and Chapter 2 Playwright helper cleanup. It preserves the current dirty work as a checkpoint commit without adding gameplay during the checkpoint pass.

Included in this checkpoint:

- `cinderfen_overlook` is a playable Chapter 2 event gate after `ashen_outpost`.
- `cinderfen_waystation` is a compact Chapter 2 town/support node after Cinderfen Overlook.
- `cinderfen_crossing` launches the authored `Cinderfen Causeway` map after the event gate is completed.
- Cinderfen Causeway includes the Cinder Shrine first-capture Aether surge and Shrine Attunement support.
- `cinderfen_watch` launches the compact `Cinderfen Watchpost` map after Cinderfen Crossing victory.
- `cinderfen_aftermath` is a compact non-battle consequence event after Cinderfen Watch.
- The compact Malrec trophy consequence is visible through the existing rival/trophy state.
- Chapter/campaign data is split into focused node and reward modules with compatibility barrels preserved.
- Chapter 2 reward-economy audit changes are preserved: Cinderfen repeat clears now pay only tiny XP/resources and no repeat battle item roll while first clears remain useful.
- Chapter 2 Playwright setup cleanup is preserved in `tests/e2e/chapter2-helpers.ts`; smoke specs keep the meaningful reward, copy, persistence, and duplicate-prevention assertions.
- Chapter 2 event, support, battle, aftermath, reward, persistence, simulator, e2e, telemetry, balance, report, and documentation changes from the current route are preserved.
- Chapter 1 remains stable in tests, e2e, and simulator telemetry.

No gameplay behavior was changed during this checkpoint request. The only post-verification edits are this checkpoint record and the corresponding handoff update.

## Verification Results

### Unit Tests

Command:

```bash
npm test
```

Result:

```text
PASS
37 test files passed
259 tests passed
Latest duration: 18.56s
```

### Production Build

Command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Result:

```text
PASS
TypeScript compile passed
Vite production build passed
Latest output: assets/index-MCPD5UO4.js, 1,914.22 kB minified / 456.45 kB gzip.
```

Known build warning:

```text
Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
```

### Browser E2E

Command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=line
```

Result:

```text
PASS
52 Playwright tests passed
Total duration: 24.2m
Slow files noted by Playwright: tests/e2e/deep-flow.spec.ts and tests/e2e/layout.spec.ts
```

Coverage includes Chapter 2 browser flows that resolve Cinderfen Overlook, use Cinderfen Waystation Shrine Attunement, win Cinderfen Crossing, verify Cinder Shrine rewards do not duplicate, win Cinderfen Watch, verify rewards persist once, resolve Cinderfen Aftermath, verify Aftermath rewards do not duplicate, and verify the Malrec trophy consequence. The Chapter 2 smoke flows now use the extracted helper module.

### Playtest Simulation

Command:

```bash
npm run playtest:sim
```

Result:

```text
PASS
Simulated 255 runs across 85 campaign battle node/profile summaries.
Regenerated PLAYTEST_TELEMETRY.md and PLAYTEST_TELEMETRY.json.
Chapter 1 telemetry remains stable.
Cinderfen Crossing and Cinderfen Watch remain structurally reasonable.
```

## Remaining Known Risks

- Human playtesting is still needed for the full Cinderfen route with no retinue, light retinue, Training Yard II, Quartermaster II, and mixed Chapter 1 upgrade states.
- Fast Army and retinue plus Training Yard II profiles can still clear Cinderfen quickly, so reward pacing should be watched before adding more Chapter 2 payouts even though repeat farming value is now tiny.
- Cinder Shrine and Shrine Attunement are intentionally modest, but human players may overvalue or miss the first-capture Aether surge without a live readability pass.
- Cinderfen Overlook, Waystation, and Aftermath choice/service copy is covered by tests, but mobile UI density should still be spot-checked in the browser.
- The Chapter 2 Playwright helper file should stay a setup/fast-forward helper only; future specs should keep meaningful gameplay assertions in the spec files.
- Rival impact is intentionally compact and Malrec-trophy-gated; broader returning-rival arcs remain future work.
- Chapter/campaign content now depends on focused data modules and compatibility barrels staying aligned.
- Vite still reports the known large Phaser bundle warning.
- Full Playwright e2e remains slow at roughly 22 minutes.

## Recommended Next Milestone

Human-verify the current Cinderfen route end to end: Overlook, Waystation, Crossing, Cinder Shrine surge/attunement, Watch, Aftermath, Results, and return-to-campaign persistence. Add no further Chapter 2 content until the current route stays green in human readability and balance review. Avoid workers, enemy construction, new factions, diplomacy, procedural generation, crafting, and broad army-management systems.
