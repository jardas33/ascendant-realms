## v0.2 Prototype Baseline - 2026-05-02

This release baseline captures the current playable Ascendant Realms prototype so it is easier to share, test, and continue from. It does not represent a content-complete game; it is the stable RTS/RPG campaign spine with Unit Veterancy V1 and Retinue Camp V1 included.

### Campaign And Skirmish Structure

- Main menu flow supports New Campaign, Continue Campaign, Skirmish, Hero Inventory, Settings, Asset Gallery, Info, and Reset Save.
- The Border Marches mini-campaign has eight authored nodes: Border Village, Old Stone Road, Marcher Camp, Aether Well Ruins, Bandit Hillfort, Chapel of the Marches, Refugee Caravan, and Ashen Outpost.
- Campaign battle nodes and standalone skirmishes launch through the shared `BattleLaunchRequest` path.
- Skirmish mode includes First Claim, Broken Ford, and Ashen Outpost with difficulty and AI-personality selection.
- Results return battle rewards, campaign node rewards, victory/defeat actions, and save updates through the shared Results flow.

### Hero Progression

- Heroes have class, origin, stats, XP, levels, skill points, skill trees, and class abilities.
- Current classes are Warlord, Arcanist, and Shepherd.
- Current equipment slots are weapon, armor, and trinket, with item instances stored in inventory and equipment referencing instance IDs.
- Victory rewards can grant XP, resources, and item instances; unique duplicate rewards convert into campaign resources.
- Equip Now and Hero Inventory both persist equipment changes and recalculate hero stats.

### RTS Battle Loop

- Battles include hero and unit selection, movement, attack commands, attack-move, projectiles, capture sites, neutral camps, enemy bases, and victory/defeat resolution.
- Player construction supports Barracks, Mystic Lodge, and Watchtower placement with previews, construction progress, production locks, and rally points.
- Unit training queues support Militia, Rangers, and Acolytes with visible progress and cancel/refund behavior.
- Research upgrades include current data-driven battle upgrades such as infantry, armor, ranger, and Aether study lines.
- Unit Veterancy V1 gives player non-hero units battle-local XP, Recruit/Seasoned/Veteran/Elite ranks, modest stat bonuses, selected-unit rank display, rank-up feedback, and Notable Veterans in victory Results.
- Retinue Camp V1 lets campaign victories save a small number of surviving Seasoned+ veterans, shows them on the Campaign Map, deploys them in future campaign battles, and removes them permanently if they die.
- Enemy AI expands, trains, defends, and sends pressure waves through data-driven personalities.

### Fog And Minimap

- Fog of war uses unseen, explored, and visible grid states, with Story difficulty able to disable fog.
- Enemy and neutral units/buildings are hidden outside current vision.
- The minimap renders units, buildings, capture sites, camps, rally points, pings, and the camera viewport.
- Minimap click-to-pan, fog toggles, alert pings, and colorblind minimap palette support are covered by automated browser tests.

### Stronghold Development

- Stronghold Development is a compact two-tier persistent-upgrade system, not a city-builder.
- Tier I upgrades are Training Yard I, Watch Post I, Quartermaster Stores I, Chapel Corner I, and Ranger Paths I.
- Tier II upgrades are Training Yard II, Watch Post II, Quartermaster Stores II, Chapel Corner II, and Ranger Paths II.
- Tier II upgrades require their matching Tier I upgrade.
- Implemented effects stay compact: starting units, starting resources, hero HP/Mana multipliers, warning lead time, Watchtower range, building vision, first-building construction speed, Militia/Ranger training speed, and Training Yard II's +1 Retinue capacity.

### Reputation Effects

- Reputation ranks exist for Free Marches, Common Folk, Old Faith, Ashen Covenant, and the Sylvan Concord placeholder.
- Shared thresholds are Friendly at 25, Honored at 50, Disliked at -25, and Hostile at -50.
- Common Folk Friendly discounts Marcher Camp services.
- Free Marches Friendly discounts Stronghold Crown costs.
- Old Faith Friendly improves Chapel Aether rewards.
- Ashen Covenant Hostile adds minor Ashen-node pressure through the existing launch-modifier path.
- Campaign choice cards show costs, adjusted rewards, reputation deltas, resulting reputation value/rank, modifiers, and completion behavior.

### Randomized Item Affixes V1

- Item instances can roll small, slot-filtered affixes from `src/game/data/itemAffixes.ts`.
- Current affixes are Sturdy, Sharp, Guarding, Aether-Touched, Commanding, Faithful, Swift, Embered, and Ranger's.
- Rarity rules are common 0-1, uncommon 1, rare 1-2, epic 2, and legendary 2-3 affixes.
- Deterministic affix generation exists for tests and scripted e2e rewards.
- Affixes persist on item instances, old empty-affix saves remain valid, and equipped affixes contribute to hero stats.
- Results and Inventory display affix names, base stats, affix stat contribution, total item stats, and equip preview deltas.

### Automated Playtest Simulator

- `npm run playtest:sim` regenerates `PLAYTEST_TELEMETRY.md` and `PLAYTEST_TELEMETRY.json`.
- The simulator currently runs 150 deterministic campaign battle runs across 50 profile-node summaries.
- Profiles include no Stronghold upgrades, Tier I paths, a Tier II Quartermaster path, and retinue-aware profiles for one Veteran Militia, one Veteran Ranger, and mixed retinue.
- Latest simulator status: no too-easy nodes, no structural too-hard nodes, Ashen Outpost beatable, and no Stronghold warnings.

### Current Verification Status

Latest full verification recorded after Retinue Camp V1:

- `npm test`: 35 test files, 194 tests passing.
- `npm run build`: passing with the known Vite large-chunk warning.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=line`: 43 Playwright tests passing.
- `npm run playtest:sim`: 150 simulated runs passing.

Known release caveat: the Vite production build reports that the main Phaser bundle is larger than the default 500 kB chunk warning threshold. This is tracked as a warning, not a failure.
